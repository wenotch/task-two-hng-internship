      <h1>Application to Join Your Amazing Team</h1>
      <p>Dear Team Lead,</p>

      <p>
        I‘m writing this letter with the intention of becoming a member of your
        esteemed organization. I’m a great fan/admirer/lover of football. <br />

        I have been involved with several related groups in the past [mention
        your past experience of working for or volunteering with some related
        organization]. I’m also good at dribbling, attacking and defending. I
        therefore urge you to consider my application for membership and kindly
        grant me the same. <br />
      </p>

      <p>
        This is my <span> email: emmanuelnwanochie247@gmail.com</span> looking
        forward to hearing from you. <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Yours sincerely, <br />
        Regards, <br />
        Nwanochie Emmanuel
